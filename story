**story**
Once upon a time there was a very thirsty crow. It was a very hot day and he could not find water anywhere. 
He was flying around and he noticed that there was a tall vase with water at the bottom of it. Since the neck of the vase was very long, his beak could not fit so he couldn't reach the water. 
He tried very hared to get the water but nothing was working. Finally, he thought of an idea. 
He started filling the vase wth rocks so the water at the bottom would rise. After a while, the water started to rise and the crow was able to drink. He used his wits to overcome his thirst.
